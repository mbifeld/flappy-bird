# flappy-bird
A recreation of the 2013 game Flappy Bird made in the Unity Game Engine

## How To Play
Clone the repo and open the src folder within the Unity Hub on version 2019.1.12.  Then simply run the game within Unity to start playing!

Once running, press space to start the game.  Every space will cause your bird to flap.  Try to get through all of the pipes without getting hit!  The game keeps track of your high score even if you quit the game, so keep on flapping!
